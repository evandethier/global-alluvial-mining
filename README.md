# River mineral mining 
**Mapping and documenting the effects of mining for gold and precious minerals in streams and rivers across the world**

***

#### What is river mineral mining?
**River mineral mining** is mining that occurs in and around rivers and streams. Such mining has a long history and many names, including "alluvial mining", "placer mining" and "hydraulic mining". We use the term "river mineral mining", or sometimes just "river mining", defined as any mining that has a direct surface water connection to a river. Sometimes, mining happens directly in rivers themselves. In other cases, miners excavate river banks, floodplains, and terraces.

#### How does river mining work?
In most cases, after excavation, miners process sediment to extract gold or other precious minerals. Often, miners do so by sending a slurry of water and sediment down a *sluice*. A sluice is a ramp or channel that has simple elements like riffles and settling boxes that use gravity to separate the precious minerals from the other sediment. Other separation methods exist as well, some larger and some smaller. But most of them use the same principle: gravity separating the targeted mineral from flowing water and sediment.

The excess sediment and water is often discharged directly into streams and rivers, either inadvertently during excavation or intentionally after separation. This input of sediment to rivers causes them to become cloudy or muddy. We measure such changes in muddiness as **"suspended sediment concentration"**, defined as the weight of sediment particles in a given volume of water. In many cases, chemical ore-processing aids, most commonly mercury, also flow into streams and rivers. Both the sediment itself and these chemical contaminants can cause serious environmental degradation in affected rivers, with negative consequences for fish and other flora and fauna.

#### Mining boom in the global tropics

River mining waned in the United States and other countries with 19th and early-20th century rushes. In some countries, legislation established regulations forbidding most river mining activity. Shifts to hard-rock mining in large pits or underground veins proved to be more lucrative in some instances. 

However, a major river mining boom, especially targeting gold, is underway across the global tropics. That boom is the subject of this work.

#### Satellite monitoring of river mining impacts

The reach and scale of the ongoing river mining boom is under appreciated. We find that such mining occurs in at least 49 countries, altering water quality and geomorphology in many river systems. We used high-resolution satellite and aerial imagery to map the locations of about 400 individual mining operations.

We built on our past work [^2][^3] and used Landsat satellite imagery to estimate how **suspended sediment concentration** has changed over time in the rivers affected by the recent mining boom. We compared mining periods to pre-mining reference periods and found major increases in almost every case. These changes likely help explain the widespread increases in river suspended sediment we identified in global rivers [^4].
